  I used the index.html file provided. I appended a table to my web page and then added new rows of data for each UFO sighting. I included a column for everything required in the assignment as well as the duration in minutes. I used a date form in my HTML document. I wrote JavaScript code that would listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
	The way I wrote my code the person using the webpage would have to enter a date and then press the “Filter Table” button to find that particular date as well as the city, state, country, shape, duration, and comments associated with that date. The image of the UFO shows up on the left corner of the web page. After searching for a specific date, the person using the webpage would be able to return to the original webpage by clicking on the “UFO Sightings” button located on the top left corner of the web page.
